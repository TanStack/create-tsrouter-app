## Styling

This project uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.

<% for(const addon of addOns.filter(addon => addon.readme)) { %>
<%- addon.readme %>
<% } %>

## Routing
<% if (fileRouter) { %>This project uses [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router). The initial setup is a file based router. Which means that the routes are managed as fiels in `src/routes`.<% } else { %>This project uses [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router). The initial setup is a code based router. Which means that the routes are defined in code (in the `./src/main.<%= jsx %>` file). If you like you can also use a file based routing setup by following the [File Based Routing](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/solid/guide/file-based-routing) guide.<% } %>

### Adding A Route
<% if (fileRouter) { %>
To add a new route to your application just add another a new file in the `./src/routes` directory.

TanStack will automatically generate the content of the route file for you.
<% } else { %>
To add a new route to your application just add another `createRoute` call to the `./src/main.<%= jsx %>` file. The example below adds a new `/about`route to the root route.

```tsx
const aboutRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  path: "/about",
  component: () => <h1>About</h1>,
});
```

You will also need to add the route to the `routeTree` in the `./src/main.<%= jsx %>` file.

```tsx
const routeTree = rootRoute.addChildren([indexRoute, aboutRoute]);
```

With this set up you should be able to navigate to `/about` and see the about page.

Of course you don't need to implement the About page in the `main.<%= jsx %>` file. You can create that component in another file and import it into the `main.<%= jsx %>` file, then use it in the `component` property of the `createRoute` call, like so:

```tsx
import About from "./components/About.<%= jsx %>";

const aboutRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  path: "/about",
  component: About,
});
```

That is how we have the `App` component set up with the home page.

For more information on the options you have when you are creating code based routes check out the [Code Based Routing](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/solid/guide/code-based-routing) documentation.
<% } %>
Now that you have two routes you can use a `Link` component to navigate between them.

### Adding Links

To use SPA (Single Page Application) navigation you will need to import the `Link` component from `@tanstack/solid-router`.

```tsx
import { Link } from "@tanstack/solid-router";
```

Then anywhere in your JSX you can use it like so:

```tsx
<Link to="/about">About</Link>
```

This will create a link that will navigate to the `/about` route.

More information on the `Link` component can be found in the [Link documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/v1/docs/framework/solid/api/router/linkComponent).

### Using A Layout

<% if (codeRouter) { %>
Layouts can be used to wrap the contents of the routes in menus, headers, footers, etc.

There is already a layout in the `src/main.<%= jsx %>` file:

```tsx
const rootRoute = createRootRoute({
  component: () => (
    <>
      <Outlet />
      <TanStackRouterDevtools />
    </>
  ),
});
```

You can use the Soliid component specified in the `component` property of the `rootRoute` to wrap the contents of the routes. The `<Outlet />` component is used to render the current route within the body of the layout. For example you could add a header to the layout like so:

```tsx
import { Link } from "@tanstack/solid-router";

const rootRoute = createRootRoute({
  component: () => (
    <>
      <header>
        <nav>
          <Link to="/">Home</Link>
          <Link to="/about">About</Link>
        </nav>
      </header>
      <Outlet />
      <TanStackRouterDevtools />
    </>
  ),
});
```
<% } else { %>In the File Based Routing setup the layout is located in `src/routes/__root.tsx`. Anything you add to the root route will appear in all the routes. The route content will appear in the JSX where you use the `<Outlet />` component.

Here is an example layout that includes a header:

```tsx
import { Outlet, createRootRoute } from '@tanstack/solid-router'
import { TanStackRouterDevtools } from '@tanstack/solid-router-devtools'

import { Link } from "@tanstack/solid-router";

export const Route = createRootRoute({
  component: () => (
    <>
      <header>
        <nav>
          <Link to="/">Home</Link>
          <Link to="/about">About</Link>
        </nav>
      </header>
      <Outlet />
      <TanStackRouterDevtools />
    </>
  ),
})
```
<% } %>
The `<TanStackRouterDevtools />` component is not required so you can remove it if you don't want it in your layout.

More information on layouts can be found in the [Layouts documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/solid/guide/routing-concepts#layouts).

## Data Fetching

There are multiple ways to fetch data in your application. You can use TanStack Query to fetch data from a server. But you can also use the `loader` functionality built into TanStack Router to load the data for a route before it's rendered.

For example:

```tsx
const peopleRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  path: "/people",
  loader: async () => {
    const response = await fetch("https://swapi.dev/api/people");<% if (typescript) { %>
    return response.json() as Promise<{
      results: {
        name: string;
      }[];
    }>;
<% } else { %>
    return response.json();
<% } %>  },
  component: () => {
    const data = peopleRoute.useLoaderData();
    return (
      <ul>
        {data.results.map((person) => (
          <li key={person.name}>{person.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    );
  },
});
```

Loaders simplify your data fetching logic dramatically. Check out more information in the [Loader documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/solid/guide/data-loading#loader-parameters).
