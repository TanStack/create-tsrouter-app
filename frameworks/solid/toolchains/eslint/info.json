  "aiDescription": "ESLint is the industry-standard JavaScript/TypeScript linter with the largest plugin ecosystem. Combined with Prettier for code formatting, it's the most flexible and widely-adopted linting setup. Key features: extensive rule library, plugin ecosystem (Solid-specific rules, accessibility, imports, etc.), custom rule authoring, and IDE integration. Choose ESLint when you need specific plugins, want maximum customization, or are working in a codebase already using ESLint. Trade-off: slower than Biome and requires more configuration, but offers unmatched flexibility and ecosystem.",
