  "aiDescription": "TanStack Form is a headless, framework-agnostic form library focused on performance and flexibility. For Solid, it provides first-class primitives that integrate with Solid's fine-grained reactivity. Key features: built-in validation adapter support (Zod, Valibot, Yup), nested object and array fields, dependent field validation, and submission handling with loading states. The Solid adapter uses Solid's signals for reactive form state, so only changed fields re-render. Choose TanStack Form when you need complex form logic, dynamic field arrays, or want validation library flexibility. It's headless—you bring your own UI components. Pair it with Solid-UI for accessible, styled form elements.",
