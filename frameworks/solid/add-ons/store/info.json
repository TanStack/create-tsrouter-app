  "aiDescription": "TanStack Store is a lightweight, framework-agnostic state management library that integrates beautifully with Solid's reactivity. Unlike Solid's built-in stores, TanStack Store provides a consistent API across frameworks and includes devtools support. Key features: no boilerplate, derived state with automatic dependency tracking, actions as simple methods, and devtools for debugging. TanStack Store is intentionally minimal—it complements TanStack Query for server state, handling only client-side UI state like modals, themes, or local preferences. Choose TanStack Store when you want consistent state management patterns with other TanStack libraries or need the devtools integration.",
