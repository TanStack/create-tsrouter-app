# Paraglide i18n

This add-on wires up ParaglideJS for localized routing and message formatting.

- Messages live in `project.inlang/messages`.
- URLs are localized through the Paraglide Vite plugin and router `rewrite` hooks.
- Run the dev server or build to regenerate the `src/paraglide` outputs.
