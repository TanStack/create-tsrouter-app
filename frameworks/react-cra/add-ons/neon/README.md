## Setting up Neon

When running the `dev` command, the `@neondatabase/vite-plugin-postgres` will identify there is not a database setup. It will then create and seed a claimable database.

It is the same process as [Neon Launchpad](https://neon.new).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Claimable databases expire in 72 hours.
